Description: The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) is a widely
    used simulator of agricultural systems.  This package includes
    functions to create, edit and run APSIM simulations from R.  It
    also includes functions to visualize the results of an APSIM simulation
    and perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of APSIM either via functions
    in the sensitivity package or by novel emulator-based functions.
